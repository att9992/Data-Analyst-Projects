# PISA Project
**Author:** Tran Anh Tong

## Dataset

Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Of those countries, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy. The survey was sponsored by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

**Important Note:** The full dataset (pisa2012.csv) is not included in this repo because it is more than 2.7GB.


## Summary of Findings

I decided to explor main questions:

**How do students perform in Math, Reading and Science literacy?** 

The vast majority of the students are scoring in each subject between 300 and 600 points, while a small portion of the total number achieves poorer (between 100 and 300 points) or greater (between 600 and 800 points) test performance. For each of these three score distributions, most students fitted within the interval of scores between 400 and 500 points.
    
    
**Does any country or gender excel in STEM tests (math and science)?**

Generally, we have seen Asian countries as being the world leaders at educating students who perform exceptionally in STEM tests. China, Singapore, Japan and Korea are typical examples. And male students appear to perform better than female students in STEM tests but inversely female students performed better than male students in reading test.
    
    
**Do students who have different backgrounds (ESCS) perform differently in PISA test**

We have discovered that students who come from countries of high ESCS have more advantage to obtain slightly higher scores in all three measured subjects.

**Does the age started learning the languagge which is used in the tests impact students' performance?**

We can see that reading performance of students learned the test language sonner is higher than students learned the language lately. The sooner students study languague, the better performance they can obtain in tests.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For my presentation, I focus on the question of opportunity and academic performance. I look at which countries had the most disadvantaged students and how they compared on the overall ESCS index. I then demonstrate that disadvantaged students performed worse and advantaged students performed better compared to the overall mean.
